  Personalized mental health checks and recommendations for college students by college students.
  
  Through a short questionnaire, MHCheck will assign you a mental health score out of 50, where 50 indicates 
possible severe anxiety or depression.

  You can either take the questionnaire as a guest or sign in with your Google account. This way, you can view your previous result and determine whether your symptoms have improved. Note that it is recommended to wait 2 weeks in between each test.
